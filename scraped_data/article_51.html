Cryptocurrency prices depend on a lot of factors like global price, market volatility, and overall demand and supply.ZebPay does not control the pricing of tokens listed under Exchange on our platform. We operate an Open Order Book exchange.The price of coins/tokens is solely determined by the buyers and sellers through demand and supply which determines the price at which a transaction takes place.The price of a token on ZebPay may be higher or lower than global prices due to this.We advise all our customers to do their own due diligence prior to trading.Please do visit our help article Why are prices different on ZebPay and other exchangesÂ to learn more.
