Some things are worth the wait.  Yes, you are right my friend …we’re back on the plate? If you’re offered a seat on a rocket ship, don’t ask what seat! Just get on to the upgraded Android beat (3.21.01). What’s new in Quick Trade? ? 1. Charts?(Always deliver more than expected!)  2. Place Buy / Sell order by specifying Amount or Quantity:(We love choices, don't we?) Tap on Quick Buy/Sell. You can either enter the amount in INR or the quantity of tokens you want to buy/sell. Now, you will be able to see the available balance within the Quick trade buy/sell screen. You will receive a preview of your trade. Your trade will be executed instantly once you click on "Place Order". Here, you can also see the Trade fee and TDS for each trade.   **  The fee you see here is just for illustration. The actual may differ from the one displayed here.  Tadddaaa!!! Your order is placed.  3. Favourite coins ?(Most awaited feature we all were waiting for!) Stop dreaming about your favourite token and start trading by adding it to your favourites (Mein apni favourite hu!)4. Sort coins by: NewNew - Displays tokens in the sequence sorted by coin launch dateWatchlist - Tokens added by you to the watchlist will display on top of the screen.Trending - Displays tokens sorted by volume traded in last 24 hoursWe know those fingers are already ready to tap dance on our quick trade screen.That isn’t it! You can also sort your coins by Coin name, Price, Volume and 24 hours change.   5. Advanced coin search ?(Like some wise guy said, “Search and you may seek”)  Search the Coin/Token with the name.  6. Link to Deposit option within the QT Trade screen?(Oh yes! Just tap on the ‘Deposit’ option if you are falling short while buying a token)   7. Detailed order history:(We are down to the T…) You can view the history of your QuickTrade transactions at any point in time by clicking on the 3 dots that are on the right side of the coin name. You can see the detailed order history for all your Quick trades once you click on “Quick Trade history” as below:  This will show you the entire trade history with Quantity, Trade value, Date & Time of the order, Order ID and fees and Price of the trade.  ** TDS is not applicable on buy trades of Crypto - INR pairs ** Price displayed in GREEN for Buy and RED for Sell trades ** Send / receive option will help you withdraw / deposit the tokens ** "Wallet history" will let you see the history of these send / receive transactions  Upcoming Features Now you may think, what's left?We tend to be self aware!Limit OrdersStay tuned for more….
