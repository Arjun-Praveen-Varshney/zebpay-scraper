Over the years, ZebPay has earned the trust of it's over 3 million users. Unfortunately, unscrupulous elements will attempt to use this goodwill to try to scam our customers into parting with their digital assets.Twitter & Social media scams are the digital version of bank robberies in broad daylight, some of the biggest scams in cryptocurrency have happened  on Twitter and other social media platforms. Indistinguishable fake handles of well known profiles can easily be created using special characters and typos. Eg: scamsters try to impersonate well known profiles like @Zebpay using handles like @Zebpay_ or @_ZebpaySupportThese scammers pose as legitimate people & entities to run giveaway scams where they ask followers for a small amount of crypto, in return for large multiples of crypto. To make it seem legit, they'll also have multiple users act like they have sent crypto and confirm they've received the reward amount as well.  Beware of such scams & #StaySafe. Notice the use of special characters in the handle, the old branding and the use of a generic email address eg:  abc_zebpay@123.com; zebpaysupport@abc.com. Please report such attempts to us at phishing@zebpay.com.All official ZebPay email addresses will have ZebPay as the domain name. Eg: help@zebpay.comHere are the official ZebPay pages on social media:Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/zebpay/Twitter: https://twitter.com/zebpayLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/zebpay/Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/zebpayofficial/YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/ZebpayTubeTelegram: https://t.me/ZebPayOfficial and https://t.me/ZebPayOfficialChat
