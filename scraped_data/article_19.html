We have upgraded our FIAT deposit infrastructure for users in Australia, and as a result, all previous fiat deposit options have been taken off the app. Please do not attempt to deposit funds via the previous deposit methods (mentioned below), as these won’t be recoverable and may result in the permanent loss of your deposits.Disabled Deposit optionsPayIDPOLiBank TransferCurrently, only the 'Manual Deposit' option is live on the app with our new bank account details. Please check the app for the current deposit option and bank account details. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to us by creating a ticket.
