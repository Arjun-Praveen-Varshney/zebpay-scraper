As Everipedia (IQ) is not available for trading, we will soon stop supporting this token on Zebpay entirely. Zebpay users holding  Everipedia (IQ) tokens in their Zebpay wallet must withdraw their tokens from Zebpay before 29 May 2020.We therefore advise all Zebpay users to withdraw their AE and ZIL tokens from Zebpay to their own wallets, to continue to have ownership of their assets.For any queries, do write to us at help.zebpay.com
