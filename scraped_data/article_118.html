Update on 16th Jan 2019:Due to a roll back in the Ethereum Constantinople Hard Fork, send and receive transactions of ETH and supported ERC 20 tokens (OMG, GNT, ZRX, REP, KNC, BAT, AE, IOST, ZIL, NCASH, TUSD) have been stopped for security reasons. This is to ensure your ETH and supported ERC 20 token holdings in Zebpay wallet are safe.We will enable ETH and supported ERC 20 token send/receive transactions once the network stabilises.Update on 2nd Feb 2019:All ETH and supported ERC20 tokens are available for send and receive and we thank you for your patience.
