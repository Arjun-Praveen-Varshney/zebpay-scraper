What is a UTR Number ( Unique Transaction Reference Number) This is a number that is unique to every IMPS/ UPI/ NEFT or RTGS transaction you do and helps us match that particular transaction to your deposit order.  Where do I get this number from? This number is given by your bank itself while processing your fund transfer. IMPS | UPI : This is a 12 digit number currently starting with 21NEFT / RTGS : This is an alphanumeric number which normally starts with your bank’s Code This will show up in your bank statementPoints to rememberDo Not change the format or edit any part of this numberAlways remember to quote this number for any fiat transactions when raising a ticket with us. For a few of the banks, the transaction ID that shows up on the deposit receipt the reference number or the transaction ID is an internal reference number for the bank. This number will only help if you are contacting your bank for this transaction.While sharing the proof or raising a query regarding your fiat deposit, please share a proof that may have the UTR number for us to investigate regarding your deposit.
