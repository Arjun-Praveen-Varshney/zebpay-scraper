Cryptocurrency delisting is a routine part of our ongoing platform management for performance and operational efficiency.We keep reviewing the cryptocurrencies listed on ZebPay.  For each cryptocurrency we add, we make sure we can provide proper liquidity and a robust trading environment. The FTT token has been subject to extreme volatility in the light of recent events. In order to maintain a safe trading environment for our users, ZebPay has decided to delist FTT token, effective on 11th Nov, 7 PM IST. Buy orders are disabled with immediate effect. Sell orders will continue for now & be paused on 11th Nov, 6 PM IST.Users with a balance of FTT tokens in their ZebPay wallet are requested to sell them prior to the scheduled delisting. Post 11th Nov IST, ZebPay will conduct automated settlement of any FTT token remaining in the user's wallet into INR at market value. Thank you for your understanding. As always, our support team is available should you have any questions.
