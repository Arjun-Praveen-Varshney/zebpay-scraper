As per the circular issued by the Central Board of Direct Taxes on June 22, 2022, TDS of 1% will be applicable on all sales/transfers of Virtual Digital Assets (“VDA”) including Crypto assets and NFTs effective July 1, 2022. As per the new law, the buyer of VDA is required to deduct 1% of the amount paid to the seller towards Tax Deducted at Source (“TDS”). This requirement has been introduced vide Section 194(S) of the Income Tax Act (the “Act”).The tax is required to be deducted at the time of credit of the amount or at the time of payment. The liability to deduct tax under Section 194(S) of the Act applies only when the value or aggregate value of the consideration for transfer of VDA exceeds Rs 50,000 during the financial year in case of consideration being paid by a specified person and Rs 10,000 in other cases. ZebPay will deduct this 1% of TDS at the time of execution of the trade and transfer of the crypto assets from July 1, 2022. The TDS will be then paid to the Government on behalf of the buyer. You can adjust this against your tax liabilities at the time of filing an income tax return. Please refer to this link for more information on Section - 194S, Income-tax Act, which mentions the taxation rules on Virtual Digital Assets.
