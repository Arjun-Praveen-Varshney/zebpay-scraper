Why are we charging the fee?We thought long and hard about whether to establish this fee.We calculated the cost of maintenance and we decided to institute a monthly wallet fee of 0.0001 BTC (or crypto equivalent) per member. This wallet fee covers a fraction of our total maintenance cost. ZebPay will continue to pay for the rest.This fee is only applied to inactive accounts ( accounts in which there have been NO trades done in the previous month).We cannot comment on the wallet security procedures or fee schedules of other exchanges, but ZebPay’s 3 million customers have never suffered a loss of their coins and our wallet security continues to be among the best available anywhere. This fee helps us maintain the security required to keep your crypto safe.How will this fee be applied?The fee will be charged on the 1st of the month for the balance on that date and cannot be prorated. It will be 0.0001 BTC per member, or its crypto equivalent value and will be deducted in crypto only.For fee calculation purposes, the month is determined based on the period from the 1st of a month at UTC 12:00 AM to the 1st of the next month at UTC 12:00 AM. This timing convention is used to determine the duration for which fees are assessed or calculated. This in Indian Standard time will be from 5:30 AM of 1st of the month to 5:30 AM of the 1st of next month.For eg: The month of Jan start at 1st Jan 00:00:00 AM UTC ie 5:30:00 AM Indian time and ends at 31st Jan 11:59:59 PM UTC ie 1st Feb 05:29:29 AM Indian time. If you make any trades or have an active lending in this time period, the membership fee will not be charged.If your balance on the 1st is zero, you won't be charged any fee, regardless of your activity for the rest of the month.If the price of BTC increases we will lower the fee accordingly. Using our Lending feature also ensures no deduction of the membership fee. If your crypto balance is below the fee, your fee amount will be reduced. At no time will your balance go below zero.If there is a verified withdrawal request pending for the entire account balance, then you will not be charged a wallet fee.You can find further details on our fees at https://zebpay.com/in/features/pricingThis fee is automatically waived off if there is even one trade done in the month.
