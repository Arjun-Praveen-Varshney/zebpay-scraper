Please Refer to ZebPay's Coin Fork policy for information on how we approach all blockchain Forks.1) I want to know about the hard fork of Bitcoin Cash, is ZebPay supporting this hard fork?  Bitcoin Cash ( BCH) is expected to perform a hard fork protocol upgrade on November 15, 2020 12:00 PM UTC. ZebPay plans to support more likely the BCH.N chain and it also depends on which one has more hashing  power (dominant chain) once the fork occurs. Token recovery will be done on the basis of our Coin Fork policy.2) Will ZebPay support BCH.A or BCH.N and will there be an addition of coins?  73.6% of BCH blocks have signalled support for BCHN, compared to 0.8% for BCHA. If this signalling status continues through the hard fork, ZebPay will treat the BCH.N chain as the future BCH chain. There will be no addition of forked coins.3) Why is ZebPay not planning on supporting the BCH.A chain?Please do refer to our Coin Fork policy for details on how we proceed with forked tokens.3) What if I want my tokens to be Forked and credited for both chains?For all members who would like their tokens to be forked, please withdraw your tokens to any other exchange / service which plans to support the old chain as well as the new forked chain. ZebPay reserves the right to NOT recover or support any of the forked chains. If so, we will NOT be crediting your ZebPay wallet with the tokens of the chain we are not supporting.4) Will ZebPay plan on supporting the BCH.A chain in the future and will you recover tokens then?We currently do not plan on supporting the BCH.A chain and we will communicate any changes to our decision in future.5) Will I be able to trade & perform BCH transactions during this hard fork ?To support the fork upgrade, ZebPay will perform the following operations on November 14, 09:30 AM (UTC).ZebPay will suspend BCH deposits and withdrawals. Trading will continue as usual and Members will be able to trade across all the BCH Exchange trading pairs.ZebPay will monitor the hard fork process and work to minimise customer disruption until the network meets ZebPay's security standards. We will monitor the Bitcoin Cash network during the upgrade.ZebPay cannot predict the duration of this upgrade process. When the upgrade is complete, we will evaluate the network and take appropriate next steps, including resuming of BCH deposits/withdrawals. We will update you throughout the upgrade process and about the outcome of the fork once the network reaches consensus. In the unlikely event that multiple viable chains persist after the fork, we will communicate when we have a clearer vision of its result.
