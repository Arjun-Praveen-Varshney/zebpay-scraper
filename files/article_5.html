Actual images may vary.Frequently asked questions!How do you calculate unrealised returns?Unrealised profit and loss is calculated as follows:Unrealised PNL= Current value (Quantity of tokens * LTP ie Last Traded Price)  - Investment Value (Quantity of tokens * Avg Buy Price)How do you calculate the unrealised returns for deposited tokens?We use the same formula for calculation of Unrealised PNL. Here the average buying price is derived based on the value of the specific token in ZebPay at the time of receipt. What is the average buying rate for token rewards and airdropped tokens?The average buying price of tokens received in rewards, lending interest, rebate and airdrops will be 0 as the user is actually not buying the token. Hence in the P&L summary, the token LTP will be taken as the rate to calculate the profit.Can I see the Profit and Loss for tokens I have sold?The new feature only shows the Unrealized P&L. This means you will get it only for the tokens that you current hold. For the tokens sold, as their value does not reflect in portfolio we would not be showing it. You may refer to your trade statements to calculate manually or can also take the support of TaxNodes if your requirement is to calculate your taxes based on Profit and loss. Why cant I see P&L for some of the tokens?For all the coins that you hold currently, the P&L summary is displayed in the Portfolio except for the delisted coins.If you have any queries related to these new features, please do reach us by creating a ticket. Our 24/7 support team will help you resolve your queries.
