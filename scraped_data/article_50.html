ZebPay does not control or influence the price of any coin/token, as we are neither buyers nor sellers.We do place some circuit limits that are dynamically updated. These limits decide the min-buy-order-price and max-sell-order-price. The purpose of these limits is merely to prevent accidental orders at incorrect prices.For e.g.:  You intended to sell BTC at INR 1790850.19 but accidentally entered only INR 1790.85.  The circuit limit will prevent this trade from going through.
