Your mobile number is your unique ID in ZebPay. Your receiving address, cryptocurrency balance and your transaction details are connected with your mobile number. We follow robust and industry leading security practises to ensure that you never need to worry about your cryptocurrency held with us.Even if you lose your mobile device, please note that no one will have access to your account without entering your 4 digit security PIN.3 or more incorrect PIN entries will result in your account being locked and to regain access, please raise a ticket.Since you lost your mobile device, we strongly advise you to inform us about it by raising a ticket  for us to place a temporary block on all outgoing transactions on your account.Once you receive a new SIM card with the same mobile number, you can confirm it to us and we will inform you about the process you need to follow to enable your account. After authentication by our compliance department, we will enable outgoing transactions of your ZebPay account.Please note: If for any reason you are unable to get the same mobile number, please raise a ticket with us and we will advise you on further steps.
