ZebPay supports sending Litecoin only to the new LTC address format. The new address format begins in an M instead of 3. This format is convertible to the old address format. If you have the old address format, you may use the Litecoin address converter at https://litecoin-project.github.io/p2sh-convert/ to convert it to the new format.
