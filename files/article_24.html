You just need to refresh the app by clicking on three horizontal lines and clicking on the "Refresh" button.  What is the fee applicable on Quick Trade buy/sell transactions?A trading fee of 0.50% of the total trade amount will apply to Quick Trade buy/sell transactions. Please refer to our Fees and Limits link for more information.  It is also available under the ‘Fees’ link on the Quick Trade screen. Where can I view the history of all the Quick Trades done by me?You can view all your trades on the Quick Trade tab by selecting the relevant pair and clicking on the history tab( three lines on the top right).  Will I get a separate statement for my Quick Trades?You can view all these trades in your trade statement with the order type ‘Quick Trade’. How is this different from Market orders on the Order Book?This feature has a simple interface that allows you to buy/sell crypto instantly and is ideal for customers new to the world of crypto. What is the reason for the variance in buy and sell prices?The main factor determining the spread ( difference between buying/selling prices )  is the trading volume. Usually, high-volume markets have a lower spread because of their higher liquidity (more competition among buyers and sellers). On the other hand, markets that are not liquid enough and present low trading volume tend to have a more significant spread. Why is the price of some coins different in Quick Trade and Exchange?Quick Trade offers you an option to buy or sell your tokens instantly without the hassle of entering the order in the order book. You can buy and sell as much as you want without worrying about liquidity. Whereas exchange works on an open order book where buyers and sellers place an order, and the price is determined solely by them.
