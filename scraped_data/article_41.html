Due to upgrades to our wallet infrastructure, we have deprecated some of our receiving addresses. Deprecated addresses can be identified by a red exclamation icon in the latest version of the app.Users are required to start using new receiving addresses and stop sending funds to addresses marked with the red exclamation icon. We’ll continue to process deposits sent to the old addresses, but will stop soon. We’ill specify the date for the change shortly.For Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Litecoin (LTC) and Bitcoin Gold (BTG) receiving addresses, you can create a new address by following the steps outlined below.For all other cryptocurrency addresses, you will automatically be assigned a new address. Please ensure that you replace your old receiving address wherever required as ZebPay will not be liable for the loss of any tokens sent to the old address once it is discontinued.1.
