<p><strong>Update on 21st Dec 2018:</strong></p><p><br/></p><p>Bitcoin Cash (BCH) network underwent a hard fork on November 15, 2018, during which the blockchain split into two: BCHABC and BCHSV. ABC block was processed at block height 556767 and SV block on a separate chain.</p><p><br/></p><p>As Zebpay supported the Bitcoin Cash hard fork, we had paused BCH sends and receives on 14th November 2018 until completion of the upgrade process and stability of blockchain.</p><p><br/></p><p>We have closely monitored BCH network and it is now stable and safe to resume BCH wallet transactions. You can perform Bitcoin Cash sends and receives from your Zebpay wallet.</p><p><br/></p><p>We are providing support for the Bitcoin ABC network only, which is identified on the Zebpay platform as Bitcoin Cash with ticker BCH. ABC chain is leading in blocks, hash rate, total chain difficulty. In your Zebpay wallet, BCHABC will be called BCH, balances will be credited in 1:1 from fork time.Â </p><p><br/></p><p>We will not be providing support for the BCH SV chain and these tokens will not be recovered.</p><p><br/></p><p>Zebpay will enable BCH trading in upcoming days for <a href="https://help.zebpay.com/support/solutions/articles/44000885475-currently-supported-cryptocurrencies-and-trading-pairs" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">supported fiat/crypto pair</a> in <a href="https://www.zebpay.com/supported-countries/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">supported countries</a>.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><strong>Update on 9th Nov 2018:</strong></p><p><br/></p><p>Zebpay would like to confirm support for the upcoming Bitcoin Cash hard fork. The next BCH hard fork is scheduled for Nov 15, 2018 16:40:00 UTC.</p><p><br/></p><p>We will pause BCH send and receive transactions on 14 November 2018 14:30:00 (UTC). Please be sure all BCH sends and receives are completed prior to that time. During the pause, your BCH will remain safely at Zebpay.</p><p><br/></p><p>Zebpay will monitor the hard fork process and work to minimise customer disruption until the network meets Zebpay's security standards. We will monitor the Bitcoin Cash network during the upgrade.</p><p><br/></p><p>Zebpay cannot predict the duration of this upgrade process. When the upgrade is complete, we will evaluate the network and take appropriate next steps, including re-enabling sends and receives. We will update you throughout the upgrade process and about the outcome of the fork once the network reaches consensus. In the unlikely event that multiple viable chains persist after the fork, we will communicate when we have a clearer vision of its result.</p><p><br/></p>
