Cryptocurrency delisting is a routine part of our ongoing platform management for performance and operational efficiency.We keep reviewing the cryptocurrencies listed on ZebPay.  For each cryptocurrency we add, we make sure we can provide proper liquidity and a robust trading environment. Based on our most recent reviews, we have delisted KEEP and DAI from ZebPay on 1st Aug 2022. The users holding any of these cryptocurrencies on the ZebPay wallet or in the Lending feature were requested withdraw or sell them before 31st Jul 2022. We will be disabling the withdrawal of delisted coins on 31st Jan 2023 11:59:59 PM. All KEEP and DAI holders are requested to withdraw the remaining balance before this. We may not be able to help recover the coins once the complete delisting is done by 31st Jan 2023.Please refer to the support article to know how you can withdraw cryptocurrency from your ZebPay wallet to other wallets.
