Please exercise caution when you send/receive any cryptocurrency as there is no way to reverse these transactions.We may be able to recover certain tokens, however, there are multiple factors that affect recovery and at times recovery may not be possible at all. And these tokens will be lost permanently.Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and Litecoin (LTC) use a similar address format and it's easy to confuse them. Similarly, Ether (ETH), ERC 20 tokens, and BEP 20 tokens have similar address formats on other networks too.1) If a token has been sent to your ZebPay wallet: Please raise a ticket with the token name, the address used to send and receive and the transaction hash, we will check if recovery is possible. Please note: Wherever recovery is possible it may take anywhere between 3-6 months and could also involve recovery charges.2) If the token has been sent out of your ZebPay wallet: Please contact the receiving wallet provider for assistance. ZebPay will be unable to assist in such cases once the transaction has been broadcast to the blockchain.
