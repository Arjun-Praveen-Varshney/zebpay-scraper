We're excited to announce the addition of a new module to the website.You may wonder what's new.Here's a quick glimpse of what's new!A brand new order management module on the web.All your exchange and QT orders are in one place.You can check all open, cancelled and traded orders for the last 1 year.All open orders can be cancelled with just 1 click.Statement requests for previous years’ trades and orders can be placed.Let’s see how it looks!Login to your account on www.zebpay.comGo to orders and you’ll see the ‘OPEN ORDERS’ tab.You can check all your open and partially open orders for 1 year under this tab. For other dates, you can use the Filter option.Here, you also have the option to filter orders by pair, side, source, order type and date range. To check the order summary, you can click on a particular order and you should be able to view order details and trade history.The next feature is Order Cancellation.
