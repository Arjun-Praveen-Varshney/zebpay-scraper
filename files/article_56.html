If you're unable to view a previously held token on ZebPay, it's possible that your token has been delisted from the platform.Please do not worry as all such tokens are still held securely with us and can be withdrawn at any time.To know more on how to withdraw tokens, please raise a ticket (https://help.zebpay.com/support/tickets/new ) with the respective token's receiving address and we'll process the withdrawal to the address provided.Please note:There are minimum limits that are applicable for withdrawing delisted tokens.The network fees required to perform these withdrawals will be equivalent to the network fees charged for USDT withdrawals. You can view the fees on our website.Once you raise a ticket, we will guide you on how we can withdraw these tokens according to these limits and fees.
