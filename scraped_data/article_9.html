This is to notify you that we have disabled the Trading of Helium (HNT).The recent circumstances that resulted in HNT being delisted by some exchanges worldwide sparked a market panic, and the coin plunged more than 20%. We had to make the difficult choice to disable the trade of HNT because of the extreme market volatility and the unclear situation.We may delist the token and this is done to safeguard the interests of the customer and prevent the loss from affecting more users.As always, we need your support and understanding. The action plan for HNT users is being finalised. Using our regular communication channels, we will shortly let you know how the process is going.Please do not hesitate to contact us in case of any queries.Wishing you a great day ahead.Regards,Team ZebPay (edited)Â
