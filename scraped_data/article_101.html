Cryptocurrency is evolving — organisations are finding ways to improve functionality and build more efficient services on their blockchains. As part of this movement to innovate, many cryptocurrencies are migrating from ERC20 tokens towards their own blockchains.Zebpay’s exchange operations are not available in India at the moment, and Aeternity (AE) and Zilliqa (ZIL) aren’t accessible for trading. We will soon stop supporting these tokens on Zebpay entirely, since their migration towards mainnet will require an architectural overhaul.Aeternity Moves to MainnetZebpay users holding Aeternity ERC20 tokens in their Zebpay wallet must withdraw their tokens from Zebpay.Once withdrawn to their own wallet, users can migrate their ERC20 AE tokens at any point before September 2019 to the mainnet. Follow their guide to migrate these tokens to the mainnet. Zebpay will only support these tokens until 2 weeks before the freeze.Zilliqa Moves to MainnetZebpay users holding Zilliqa ERC20 tokens in their Zebpay wallet must withdraw their tokens from Zebpay.Zebpay will only support these tokens till September 17,2019We therefore advise all Zebpay users to withdraw their AE and ZIL tokens from Zebpay to their own wallets, to continue to have ownership of their assets.For any queries, do write to us at help.zebpay.com
