Self trading is a term used to denote two orders that get matched with each other with no resultant change in ownership of either traded coin.These orders will be rejected by the system.These trades are considered manipulative and we at ZebPay do not support or intend to portray false liquidity in the order book.Â Note: Self-trading is not allowed or supported on the ZebPay exchange.
